description: "We drop by Mitch’s house in Neosho to make a simple beef chili that pairs with beer from his brewery, Indian Springs Brewing Company. While the chili simmers, we talk about his journey from Methodist minister to brewery owner, his son who travels the world as a chef, and the local beer scene."
recipe:
  ingredients:
    - "2 pounds ground beef"
    - "1 large onion, diced"
    - "3 cloves garlic, minced"
    - "2 cans (14–15 oz) diced tomatoes"
    - "2 cans (14–15 oz) kidney or pinto beans, drained and rinsed (optional)"
    - "1 can (8 oz) tomato sauce"
    - "1–2 cups beef broth or water"
    - "1 bottle beer (about 12 oz) – lager or amber works great (you can use some in the pot, rest for drinking)"
    - "2–3 tablespoons chili powder"
    - "1 tablespoon ground cumin"
    - "2 teaspoons smoked paprika (optional)"
    - "1/4–1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, to taste)"
    - "1–1 1/2 teaspoons salt (to taste)"
    - "1 teaspoon black pepper"
    - "Toppings: shredded cheese, sour cream, chopped onion/green onion, jalapeños, hot sauce, crackers or cornbread"
  directions:
    - "In a large pot or Dutch oven, cook the ground beef over medium‑high heat, breaking it up as it cooks. When mostly browned, pour off excess fat if needed."
    - "Add the diced onion and cook 3–5 minutes until softened."
    - "Stir in the minced garlic and cook about 30 seconds, just until fragrant."
    - "Sprinkle in chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, cayenne, salt, and black pepper. Stir well and cook 1 minute to wake up the spices."
    - "Pour in the diced tomatoes (with their juice), tomato sauce, and about 1 cup beef broth or water. If using beer in the chili, add about 1/2 bottle (6 oz) now and stir to combine."
    - "Stir in the drained and rinsed beans, if using. If the chili looks very thick, add a bit more broth or water so it can simmer without sticking."
    - "Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer uncovered 30–45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add more liquid if needed and adjust seasoning to taste."
    - "Ladle chili into bowls and top with shredded cheese, sour cream, onions/green onions, jalapeños, and hot sauce as desired. Serve with crackers or cornbread and Mitch’s beer on the side."
